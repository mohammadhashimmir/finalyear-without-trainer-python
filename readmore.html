                <h1>What Haircut Should I Get?</h1>
                 <p>If you’ve ever wondered what hairstyles suit you and how you should cut your hair, here’s a list of the coolest styles to get in 2021. We’ve broken down the different hairstyles for men according to face shape – oval, long, round, square, diamond, and triangle. If you catch yourself asking “what kind of haircut should I get?”, check out the best men’s hairstyles below to help you choose the right haircut.</p>
                 <br>
                 <h2>Best Haircuts For Men By Face Shape</h2>
                 <p>Because your head shape can influence how different cuts and styles looks on you, it only makes sense to know what face shapes and hairstyles are compatible. For example, because of their facial features and dimensions, what haircut an oval or long face man should get is obviously different than the best hairstyle for a round face man. This is why categorizing guy’s haircuts according to head shape is one of the most logical ways of ensuring you get a good cut at the barbershop.</p>
                 <br>
                 <p>Below, we’ve described each of the different men’s face shapes as well as provided examples and pictures of popular styles. From the quiff, pompadour, slick back, textured crop, and faux hawk on top to the types of fades and undercuts on the sides, here are the best haircuts for men by face shape.</p>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <h2>Hairstyles for Oval Face Shape</h2>
                 <p>There are many stylish hairstyles for oval faces. The defining feature of an oval face shape is the absence of sharp angles or corners near the forehead, cheeks and chin. Because of their symmetry and balance, most hairstyles look great on oval faces, including fades and undercuts with comb overs, quiffs, pompadours, textured slick backs, and spiky hair. However, avoid fringes and bangs that could cover your forehead and make your face appear rounder.
</p><br>
                 <p>Facial hair and beards are optional for guys with oval faces. Because of the soft, smooth contours of the jawline, go clean-shaven.</p>
                 <br>
                 <h2>Brush Back</h2>
                 <img src="./images/Brush-Back.jpg">
                 <br>
                  <h2>Undercut with Comb Over</h2>
                 <img src="./images/Undercut-with-Comb-Over.jpg">
                 <br>
                  <h2>Mid Fade with Pompadour</h2>

                 <br>
                  <h2>Taper Fade with Quiff</h2>
                 <img src="./images/Taper-Fade-with-Quiff.jpg">
                 <br><br>
                 <h2>Hairstyles for Round Face Shape</h2>
                 <p>There are also a variety of cool hairstyles for round face shapes. Round faces are about equal in length and width, and the jawline offers no sharp corners or defining edges. To create the illusion that the face is longer, consider hairstyles that are short on the sides but add height or volume.</p>
                 <br>
                 <p>The best hairstyles for round faces include undercuts and high fades coupled with pompadours, faux hawks (fohawks), fringes, side parts, quiffs, spiky hair, and long textured comb overs or slick backs.
</p>
                 <br>
                 <p>While a beard isn’t needed for round-faced men, a full square beard can give the jaw a more chiseled look.</p>
                 <br>
                 <h2>Bald Fade with Slick Back</h2>
                 <img src="./images/Bald-Fade-with-Slick-Back.jpg">
                 <br>
                 <h2>High Skin Fade with Pompadour</h2>
                 <img src="./images/High-Skin-Fade-with-Pompadour.jpg">
                 <br>
                 <h2>Side Swept Brush Up</h2>
                 <img src="./images/Side-Swept-Brush-Up-.jpg">
                 <br>
                 <h2>Spiky Hair</h2>
                 <img src="./images/Spiky-Hair.jpg">
                 <br><br>
                 <h2>Hairstyles for Square Face Shape</h2>
                 <p>The best hairstyles for square face shapes tend to be short and manly. Square faces are angular, sharp and masculine. Like round face shapes, square faces mean the length and width measurements are similar – the only difference is the angle of the jaw is sharper.</p>
                 <br>
                 <p>Because of its versatility, the best haircuts for square faces range from really short men’s haircuts, such as undercuts, buzz cuts or crew cuts, to longer styles that add some volume to the top, such as brush ups, quiffs, pomps, messy crops, long comb overs and traditional slick backs.</p>
                 <br>
                 <p>Men with square faces may grow some light stubble to soften the sharpness of the chin and jawline.</p>
                 <br>
                 <h2>Buzz Cut</h2>
                 <img src="./images/Buzz-Cut.jpg">
                 <br>
                 <h2>High Fade with Quiff</h2>
                 <img src="./images/High-Fade-with-Quiff.jpg">
                 <br>
                 <h2>Crew Cut</h2>
                 <img src="./images/Crew-Cut.jpg">
                 <br>
                 <h2>Textured Comb Over</h2>
                 <img src="./images/Textured-Comb-Over.jpg">
                 <br><br>
                 <h2>Hairstyles for Long Face Shape</h2>
                 <p>The best hairstyles for long face shapes generally help even out the dimensions of the head. Sometimes called “oblong” or “rectangular”, long faces are longer than they are wide. To avoid your face looking even longer, men with oblong faces should try short haircuts on top, such as a crew or buzz cuts. However, if you want more volume on top, skip the short fade on the sides and you can style your hair with a side part, comb over, or short brush up/spiky hair.</p>
                 <br>
                 <p>Guys with oblong faces also shouldn’t grow out a beard that will further elongate the face’s shape.</p>
                 <br>
                 <h2>Brush Up</h2>
                 <img src="./images/Shapes-Brush-Up.jpg">
                 <br>
                 <h2>Side Part</h2>
                 <img src="./images/Shapes-Side-Part.jpg">
                 <br>
                 <h2>Side Swept Crew Cut</h2>
                 <img src="./images/Side-Swept-Crew-Cut.jpg">
                 <br>
                 <h2>Short Spiky Hair</h2>
                 <img src="./images/Shapes-Short-Spiky-Hair.jpg">
                 <br><br>
                 <h2>Hairstyles for Diamond Face Shape</h2>
                 <p>The top hairstyles for diamond faces are actually some of the hottest cuts and styles trending today. A diamond face shape is characterized by strong, wide cheekbones and a defined, angular chin. Because diamond-shaped faces are typically long and narrow, barbers and stylists recommend a layered, high-volume hairstyle, such as a fringe, faux hawk (fohawk), brush up, side sweep, shag, long slick back, or textured crop.</p>
                 <br>
                 <p>Men with diamond faces may consider growing some facial hair to soften the chin and jaw.</p>
                 <br>
                 <h2>Textured Crop</h2>
                 <img src="./images/Textured-Crop.jpg">
                 <br>
                 <h2>Faux Hawk (Fohawk)</h2>
                 <img src="./images/Faux-Hawk-Fohawk.jpg">
                 <br>
                 <h2>High Fade with Fringe</h2>
                 <img src="./images/High-Fade-with-Fringe.jpg">
                 <br>
                 <h2>Slick Back</h2>
                 <img src="./images/Shapes-Slick-Back.jpg">
                 <br><br>
                 <h2>Hairstyles for Triangle Face Shape</h2>
                 <p>Trendy hairstyles for triangle faces tend to be longer and layered. Triangular face shapes accentuate angular features, most notably with the jawline being wider than the cheekbones. To offset the smaller forehead and create symmetry, the ideal haircut for guys with triangle face shapes is to avoid short fades on the sides and try medium-length textured hairstyles on top, such as swept bangs, angular fringes, and messy hair.
</p>
                 <br>
                 <p>Given the prominence of the jawline, most men would do best clean-shaven.</p>
                  <br>
                 <h2>Comb Over</h2>
                 <img src="./images/Shapes-Comb-Over.jpg">

                 <h2>Crew Cut</h2>

                 <h2>Textured Quiff</h2>
